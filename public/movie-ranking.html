<h1>The Best Movies According to Ionut</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>8 Mile</h3>
<p>This is like my favorite movies of all-time, because it shows the struggles and the grind, the sacrifices this rapper had to bear, not only that, this movie shows the harsh things of the ghetto and life itself, friends coming and go, plus I love when Eminem roasts Papa Doc to the ground! </p>
<h3>Fast and Furious 7</h3>
<p>Cars, I love race cars, everything about cars, and I chose this movie because it was Paul Walker's movie before the F&S franchise went down to dust with all that military stuff.</p>
<h3>Miami Bici</h3>
<p>This one is a romanian made movie about two romanians going to, well you guessed it, Miami! And there are a ton of inside jokes that us Romanians understand, which I find this movie pretty funny.</p>
