<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Ionut, I am 20 years old, soon to be 21 on 11/02/2024. I am currently learning on how to become a webdeveloper so I can make websites for people in need, other than that, I love it so far, and I am sure I will still love it in the future, leaving that aside, I am a gym-goer, going to the gym really made my life really change phyisically and mentally, for me personally, it was only ups, and not downs, because it taught me how to be consistent, and not chase motivation, and this way I am using that constitency that I learned back in the gym to keep on learning web development.</p>
   <p>Another hobby that I love is reading, personal development books, writers like "Jeff Keller, Leil Lowndes, Dale Carnegie, etc...".</p>
   <p>Anyways, I will stop boring you now, it was nice meeting you stranger! I hope you have a great day.</p>
